## 🧠 Why Spring Boot for a Portfolio?
While many portfolios are static, I chose **Spring Boot** to demonstrate my backend expertise. This project serves as a live proof of concept for:
* MVC Architecture implementation.
* Handling Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Thymeleaf.
* Integrating 3rd Party APIs (AI Models) in a Java environment.
